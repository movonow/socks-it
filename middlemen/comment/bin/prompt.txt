implementation for the topic discussion web server:

Requirements:
Basic Topic-Discussion Application:

Create a Go-based web server that manages discussion topics.
Topics have a title, content, and a list of comments.
Topics should be stored in memory (no database required).
Users can create topics and add comments to topics.
Comment Functionality:

Each topic has a list of comments with an author, content, and timestamp.
A cap on the number of comments per topic (e.g., 5 comments max), meaning new comments will overwrite the oldest ones.
Use container/ring to implement a circular buffer for storing comments.
Global Incrementing Comment IDs:

Ensure that comment IDs are globally unique and always increment.
New comments across all topics should have unique IDs.
Endpoints:

Create a topic (/topics/create): Allows users to create new topics.
List all topics (/topics): Fetches all topics.
Get a specific topic by ID (/topic?id=<id>): Returns a single topic's details.
Add a comment to a topic (/topic/comment?id=<id>): Adds a comment to a topic.
Get all comments for a topic (/topic/comments?id=<id>): Fetches all comments for a topic.
Fetch a batch of comments by ID range (/topic/comments/range?id=<id>&start=<start>&end=<end>): Fetches comments within a specific ID range.
Get the latest comment ID (/topic/comments/latest?id=<id>): Fetches the ID of the latest comment on a topic.
Implementation Details:
Circular Buffer for Comments:

container/ring is used to limit the number of comments stored per topic to a fixed number (e.g., 5). New comments will overwrite the oldest ones.
Global Comment ID:

Introduced a global globalCommentID to ensure unique, ever-increasing IDs for comments across all topics.
Endpoints:

The following endpoints were added to meet the requirements:
Create a topic: Users can create a new topic with a title and content.
List all topics: Fetches all available topics.
Get a specific topic: Returns the details of a specific topic, including its comments.
Add a comment: Allows users to add a comment to a topic. Each comment has a unique, globally incremented ID.
Get comments by ID range: Allows fetching a batch of comments by providing an ID range.
Get the latest comment ID: Fetches the most recent comment's ID for a given topic.
Summary of Code Changes:
Topics and comments are stored in-memory using Go structs.
container/ring is used to limit the number of comments stored per topic.
A global globalCommentID ensures each comment gets a unique ID.
Several HTTP endpoints are created to support operations like creating topics, adding comments, fetching comments by range, and querying the latest comment ID.
